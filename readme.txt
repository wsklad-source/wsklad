== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is activation in the settings and what does it give? =
Activation allows the WSKLAD team to work on improving the plugin and release updates. In addition to providing financial assistance to improve WSKLAD, projects with activation have additional features, transmit statistical information and error data in the background for further release of updates.

= Missing feature, how to add it? =
First of all, you need to look at the section with extensions on the official website. If there is no extension that adds the desired feature, you can develop this feature yourself, or turn to paid services.
You can also try to ask to add this feature for free (if activated) to the main plugin, or try to implement it through actions and filters (extensibility mechanism).

= Are updates being released? =
Updates are released as needed, but only when available to the WSKLAD team. For more or less guaranteed receipt of timely updates, you can purchase an activation code. On average, updates are needed once a month when WordPress, WooCommerce updates are released.
